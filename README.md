# Bank-Marketing-Campaign-Analysis_Phase-4
ðŸ’¾ Phase 4 â€“ Model Saving & Deployment Preparation
Project Title: Bank Marketing Campaign Analysis

ðŸŽ¯ Objective:
Save the finalized, optimized machine learning models for future use or deployment.

Ensure model reproducibility and make them ready for integration in real-world applications.

ðŸ§  Final Models:
Classification Model: Best version of RandomForestClassifier (from GridSearchCV)

Regression Model: Best version of RandomForestRegressor (from GridSearchCV)

ðŸ”§ Tools Used:
joblib: A Python library for serializing Python objects like ML models.

ðŸ“‚ Output:
best_classifier_model.pkl â€” Serialized classification model

best_regressor_model.pkl â€” Serialized regression model

âœ… Print confirmation: "Models saved successfully!"
